==============================================================================
HASKELL							*ft-haskell-plugin*

Allows for easier editing of Haskell source files. There is a preliminary
foldexpr, but it is rather slow.

Options:
'comments'		is set to allow -- and {- -} style comments
'formatoptions'		is set to break comment lines but not others
'cpoptions'		is set to not match \( as special, so lambdas work
'includeexpr'		is set so that gf works on import lines

Local mappings:
<LocalLeader>t	    	if ghci is in the path, puts the type of the 
			identifier at the start of the line into the 
                        previous line, overwriting that line if it is 
                        a type declaration for that identifier. Will
                        only consider the declarations that are already
                        written to disk!

Variables:
g:haskell_folding	If set, enables the slow foldexpr
g:ftplugin_haskell_source_path
			Adds the given path to the search path for gf
