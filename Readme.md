This is my .vimrc

I have used it for about 8 years now and it is wonderful.
I originally copied it from Botje.
I honestly have no idea what half of this stuff does or if I even need it.
There's a Sokoban plugin in it somewhere.
Why would I even need that in my text editor.

This .vimrc is awesome.
